# invoice-manager-backend
Node.JS backend for the [invoice manager](https://github.com/KevinVanthuyne/invoice-manager)

## Running the backend
Make sure you have MongoDB installed locally. The backend will try to connect to it on the default port (`27017`).

Run `node` or `nodemon` in the project to start the backend. The api will be accessable on `http://localhost:3000/api`.
